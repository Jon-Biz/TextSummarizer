# Real-Time Transcription Implementation Plan

## Backend Changes

1. **Update API Endpoint**: Modify the existing API endpoint or create a new one to accept streaming audio data from the frontend. This endpoint should be able to handle chunked data uploads.

2. **Incremental Transcription**: Integrate a speech recognition library like Whisper to incrementally transcribe the audio data as it is received. This may involve setting up a separate worker process or thread to handle the transcription task.

3. **Partial Transcription Response**: As the transcription progresses, send the partial transcription back to the frontend at regular intervals or when a certain amount of new text is available.

## Frontend Changes

1. **Audio Recording**: Add functionality to capture audio from the user's microphone using the Web Audio API or similar libraries.

2. **Audio Streaming**: Implement a mechanism to stream the recorded audio data to the backend API in chunks or small segments.

3. **Progress Indicator**: Create a new UI component to display the transcription progress. This could be a progress bar, spinner, or any other visual indicator that shows the user that transcription is in progress.

4. **Partial Transcription Display**: Develop a UI component to display the partial transcription as it is received from the backend. This component should update dynamically as new transcription data becomes available.

5. **Integration with Existing UI**: Integrate the new audio recording, streaming, and transcription display components with the existing UI. This may involve modifying the existing components or creating new ones to handle the real-time transcription functionality.

## Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms for scenarios such as microphone access issues, network failures, or backend errors.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explore techniques to optimize the performance of the transcription process, such as using web workers or offloading computationally intensive tasks to the backend.
- **User Experience**: Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience by providing clear instructions, visual feedback, and appropriate error messages.
- **Testing**: Develop comprehensive test cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the new functionality.
