# Real-Time Transcription Implementation Plan

## Frontend Changes

3. **Progress Indicator**: Create a new UI component to display the transcription progress. This could be a progress bar, spinner, or any other visual indicator that shows the user that transcription is in progress.

5. **Integration with Existing UI**: Integrate the new transcription display components with the existing UI. This may involve modifying the existing components or creating new ones to handle the transcription functionality.

## Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms for scenarios such as backend errors.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explore techniques to optimize the performance of the transcription process, such as using web workers or offloading computationally intensive tasks to the backend.
- **User Experience**: Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience by providing clear instructions, visual feedback, and appropriate error messages.
- **Testing**: Develop comprehensive test cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the new functionality.
