- Update main.py to use new config module ✓
- Fix import issues and verify application runs with uvicorn ✓

### Step 3: Create Data Access Layer ✓
- Create repository/transcript_repository.py ✓
- Create repository/summary_repository.py ✓
- Move file operations and data loading logic ✓
- Implement repository pattern as per system patterns ✓
- Create repository/__init__.py ✓
- Remove original file_storage.py ✓
- Update main.py to use new repositories ✓

### Step 4: Create Services Layer ✓
- Create services/transcription_service.py for Whisper integration ✓
- Create services/summarization_service.py for OpenAI integration ✓
- Create services/__init__.py ✓
- Move business logic from main.py ✓
- Update main.py to use new services ✓

### Step 5: Reorganize Routes ✓

## Current Status
✓ Completed Step 1: Models module created and working
✓ Completed Step 2: Configuration module created and working
✓ Completed Step 3: Data access layer created and working
✓ Completed Step 4: Services layer created and working
✓ Completed Step 5: Routes reorganized and centralized
✓ Completed Step 6: Final main application refactoring

The refactoring process is now complete. The backend has been restructured into modular components following SOLID principles and best practices.

## Next Steps
1. Thoroughly test all endpoints to ensure functionality is maintained
2. Update documentation if necessary
3. Consider any performance optimizations or additional features

## Active Decisions
- Followed repository pattern for data management
- Implemented service layer for business logic
- Maintained FastAPI best practices
- Kept files under 45 lines where possible
- Centralized route definitions in api/routes.py
- Minimized main.py to essential application setup
