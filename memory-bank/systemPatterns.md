# System Patterns for TextSummarizer

## Architecture

- Microservice architecture
- Separation of concerns between frontend and backend

## Key Components

## Design Patterns

- Repository pattern for data management
- Service layer for business logic
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- State management in frontend (React hooks)

## Communication Patterns

- RESTful API between frontend and backend

## Error Handling

- Centralized error handling
